### Added Models (Instruct Agent)
The following models were added to the top of the Instruct Agent model selection list:

- `openai/gpt-5` (display name: gpt-5)
- `openai/gpt-5-chat` (display name: gpt-5-chat)
- `openai/gpt-5-mini` (display name: gpt-5-mini)

These appear first in the dropdown, preserving the original order of existing models beneath them.

> NOTE: Ensure backend or proxy supports these model identifiers before production use.
